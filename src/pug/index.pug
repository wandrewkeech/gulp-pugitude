        h1 Liveserver has started and opened your browser window
        h2 Let's start with some basics
        div.row
            div.col-4
                p. 
                  This content is some
                  run on, multi-line sep
                  arated <b>con
                  tent</b> inside of one

                  "p." tag, which renders out into

                  one paragraph tag. However, the line breaks show up as breaks in
                  the text all the same. Sadly, `live-server` is not refreshing the browser itself
                  when run as a gulp task.
            div.col-8
                p.
                    Here is some text in a second column. Cool to see.
        div.row
                p.col-6
                a(href="galleries/gallery1.html") Link to templated page
                p.col-6 Here is some text offset to the centre of the container div.
