            h3 This page was rendered out from a layout using the "include" syntax
            p.
                Here we go with some proper line breaks
            p.
                and whatever
            br
            //- Note the use of HTML to force formatting, it's passed through untouched
            p.
                Using linebreaks between paragraphs creates lots of separation, as above.
                Normal separation is achievable by marking new paragraphs with their own "p."
                at the same level of indentation.
                The position of this column of text is created by using nested classes
                on the containing div:<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;"div.row"<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "div.col-7.prefix-2"
                
            p.
                Let's use this page to demo a script which iterates over a content
                directory and blasts out a bunch of linking anchor tags, and explore
                a way to include captions and other info through a sidecar file.
