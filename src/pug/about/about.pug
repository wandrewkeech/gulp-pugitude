    p.
        Pugitude is all about putting together the straight-forward static
        site generator that I wish already existed. Where most any other 
        offering is oriented toward blog content, Pugitude makes no assumptions
        about your content, so there's no opinion to work around. I wanted
        to make a generator that would allow making portfolio or gallery sites
        sensible and streamlined.

        If you check the source file in `./src/jade/about/about.jade` you'll
        see this content was written in `Markdown` and run through Pug's
        internal processor.
